# Pong Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Python's Turtle graphics library.

## Files

The project consists of four Python files:

1. `main.py`: The main game loop and setup
2. `paddle.py`: Defines the Paddle class
3. `ball.py`: Defines the Ball class
4. `scoreboard.py`: Defines the Scoreboard class

## How to Play

1. Run `main.py` to start the game.
2. The left paddle is controlled using the 'W' and 'S' keys.
3. The right paddle is controlled using the 'Up' and 'Down' arrow keys.
4. The game continues indefinitely, keeping score for both sides.

## Game Features

- The ball speeds up slightly each time it hits a paddle.
- The score is displayed at the top of the screen.
- The ball resets to the center and changes direction when a point is scored.

## Dependencies

This game requires Python 3 and the Turtle graphics library, which comes pre-installed with Python.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. Download all four Python files (`main.py`, `paddle.py`, `ball.py`, and `scoreboard.py`) into the same directory.
3. Run `main.py` using Python to start the game.

## Controls

- Left Paddle:
  - 'W': Move Up
  - 'S': Move Down
- Right Paddle:
  - 'Up Arrow': Move Up
  - 'Down Arrow': Move Down

Enjoy the game!
